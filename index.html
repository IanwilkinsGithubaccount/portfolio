<div class= "monospace">
    I would spend a 1200 dollar check only on rent or other necesary things. Stuff like food I would just use spare money that I had no imediate need to use because you can go sometime without food.

    <h1>Where would I be after a few months of no money</h1>
</div>  
<div class= "p.impact">
    After a few months of no money I am not sure what I would do. In time like that I would guess many people would be in the same situation as me so I would pay attention to what they're doing.
</div>
<div class= "monospace">
    <h1>What would I do for 2 months or three months</h1>
</div>  
<div class= "monospace">
I would do the same as the question above because I really don't know that much about that

<div class= "monospace">
    <h1>How would I handle an apocolypse?</h1>
</div>  
<div class= "monospace">
Economically I am not sure what I would do because during an apocolypse most businesses would be closed and the stock market would cease to exist for the time being. I am judging this off the fact that there would've been a zombie apocalypse for this apacolypse. I 
would probably try and hide because I do not want to get turned into a zombie.
